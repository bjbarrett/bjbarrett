## Moin!

I am an evolutionary behavioral ecologist and quantitative anthropologist currently working at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior (Department for the Ecology of Animal Societies) and the University of Konstanz (Department of Biology and Center for the Advanced Study of Collective Behavior).
I am a group leader of the [Inheritance and Social Learning Across Scales research group](https://www.ab.mpg.de/232529/Capuchin-tool-use).
I help out a lot of researchers with Bayesian Stats, whether it is hierarchical modelling, translating theoretical models to statistical models, or analyzing dyadic data using the social relations model (or close analogues thereof).
I am beginning lots of projects that have to deal with computer imaging and developing CNN's to identify individual monkeys and their age/sex/dyadic relatedness from images and camera trap data.
I primarily code in R and Mathematica, but have experience with Python, Google Earth Engine and Julia.
I like open science and am keenly interested in quality control in data collection and management, and best (inclusive) practices and naming collections for data collection in cross-cultural teams in field ecology.
