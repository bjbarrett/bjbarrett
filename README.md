## Moin!

I am an evolutionary behavioral ecologist currently working at the University of Konstanz (Department of Biology and Center for the Advanced Study of Collective Behavior).
I also lead the [Innovation and Social Learning Across Space research group](https://www.ab.mpg.de/232529/Capuchin-tool-use) at the Max Planck Institute' Department for the Ecology of Animal Societies.
I help out a lot of researchers with Bayesian Stats, whether it is hierarchical modelling, translating theoretical models to statistical models, or analyzing dyadic data using the social relations model (or close analogues thereof).
I am beginning lots of projects that have to deal with computer imaging and developing CNN's to identify individual monkeys and their age/sex/dyadic relatedness from images and camera trap data.
I primarily code in R and Mathematica, but have experience with Python, Google Earth Engine and Julia.
I like open science and am keenly interested in quality control in data collection and management, and best (inclusive) practices and naming collections for data collection in cross-cultural teams in field ecology.
